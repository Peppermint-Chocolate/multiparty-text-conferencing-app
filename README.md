# Multi-Party Text Conferencing 

This project uses UNIX TCP sockets to implement a multi-party text conferencing
application. The communication system consists of two components - the server and the client. Once persistent connection has been established with the server with valid credentials, clients located on different networks can communicate with each other by creating, joining, exchanging messages within, and quitting from conference sessions (virtual chat rooms).
